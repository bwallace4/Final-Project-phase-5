## Description
I had to create a phase 5 final project for The Flatiron school.
First I used a Flask/SQLAlchemy API backend with a React frontend, But I had to create my own API. Creating models and using crud actions that included create,read, update and delete. I also included different client-side routes using React Router. I protected passwords for all of my users when I implemented password hashing and authentication. When registering and logging in I used validations to set standards on my input fields. Then i connected the backend to the frontend using fetch().

Fork & clone https://github.com/bwallace4/Final-Project-phase-5.git repository 
cd into Final-Project-phase-5 
cd intto server 
run the main directory with python app.py
You should see this message
